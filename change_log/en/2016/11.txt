**Name change of the method ``remove`` of the class ``parse.WalkInAST``:** the new name is ``remove_extras`` (see the new big novelty below).


**Adding a context handler to the ``parse.WalkInAST`` class:** this implies that the classes ``data.Read``, ``data.ReadBlock`` and ``clean.Clean`` can be used via a syntax like ``with. ... as ...:`` instead of using the methods ``build`` and ``remove_extras``.

**Storage in the JSON format of the dictionaries created by the class ``data.ReadBlock``:** here are the two features added.

     1) Adding a method ``jsonify`` to the` `data.ReadBlock`` class so as to produce a string giving a JSON variable representing one of the dictionaries proposed to read the datas (this can be useful for permanent storage and/or to interact with other applications).

     2) The function ``loadjson`` does the opposite work of the method ``data.ReadBlock.jsonify``.
