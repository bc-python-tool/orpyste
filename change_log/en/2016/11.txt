**Storage in the JSON format of the dictionaries created by the class ``data.ReadBlock``:** here are the two features added.

     1) Adding a method ``jsonify`` to the` `data.ReadBlock`` class so as to produce a string giving a JSON variable representing one of the dictionaries proposed to read the datas (this can be useful for permanent storage or to interact with other applications).
